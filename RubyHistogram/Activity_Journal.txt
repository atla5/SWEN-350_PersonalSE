SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
Ruby - RubyHistogram

Name: Aidan Sawyer

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI:
  -go through steps outlined in write-up.
  -get lines of file/stdin
  -parse through line, removing all of the unwanted characters and print
  -break line into list of words and print each
  -put words into a dictionary, print word and occurence
  -change occurence number to appropriate number of *s

TA:
  -accept a few prescribed input files
  -test with general input using 'CTRL-D' to stop stream

ET:
  -i've not done ruby in a while and the list of steps is rather long
  -i know regexs and ruby stdin got me last semester, so i'm anticipating
   relearning it to take a while.

Complete
Actual Time	03 30
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

PE:
  -as expected, i had some trouble with the regex removing non-alpha chars
  -had a few problems with stdin as well, but that was resolved
  -had a two second problem with not converting the argument to an integer.

LL:
  -the '!' for the smaller functions make a lot of difference.

ETC:
  -i probably should have refactored everything into a couple functions,
   but wasn't sure where or how and it didn't seem entirel necessary.
