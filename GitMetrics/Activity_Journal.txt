PE:
  -took a while to get used to 'Dates', but once i reread the 
   documentation provided in the assignment it wasn't hard at all.
   (wasn't using DateTime.parse() to begin with)
  -had a couple tests that weren't written well. don't forget to
   question those when you're pretty sure the code's fine.
