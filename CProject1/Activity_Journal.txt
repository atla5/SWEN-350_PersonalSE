C Health Monitoring System Project - Part 1

Name: Aidan Sawyer

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 50
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI:
  -clean up, comment, document, look over requirements, etc.
  -declare variables for id, time, type, value
  -write read_line(&id,&time,&type,&val) method to parse stdin
   and write to the variables declared within while loop in main()
  -write print statements

TA:
  -bash script comparing actual to expected output.
  

Complete
Actual Time	01 15
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

PE: 
  -had a bit of trouble with writing to the timestamp (char * time[]).
   was an issue of...

TT:
  -could have hacked it out sooner, but i wanted to make it as simple
   and efficient as possible.

failed compiles: 18

===========  PROJECT PART 1 SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================
(Replace this text with a couple of paragraphs summarizing your
experience with this project. What is too easy or too hard? What
was the most challenging technical problem you faced? How
did your estimated and actual time compare? Did your estimates
improve as you advanced to later stages? Why or why not?)
