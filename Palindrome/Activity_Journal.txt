Python - Palindrome

Name: Aidan Sawyer
LOC/hr: 70/.75 = 93.33

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 50
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI: 
  - create test input file with known palindromes and nonpalindromes
  - create test script 
  - write is_palindrome() and its helper functions to take a line and 
    test returns
  - write functionality to take in whole files

TA:
  - bash script to compare output of palindrome.py and the file
    itself. if any known palindromes show up in the diff, the program has
    missed it and needs to be edited.
  - i'll have to write some print-outs in the code itself to make
    sure that no non-palindromes are incorrectly marked as palindromes.

Actual Time	HH 45
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

PE:
  - had a bit of trouble with the newline character at the end of each line
  - had some problems writing the shell script, but i'm convinced it's working
    correctly looking at the printout.
