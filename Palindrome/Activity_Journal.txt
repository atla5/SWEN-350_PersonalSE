Python - Palindrome

Start
Estimated Time	00 50
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI: 
  - create test input file with known palindromes and nonpalindromes
  - create test script 

TA:
  - bash script to compare output of palindrome.py and the file
    itself. if any known palindromes show up in the diff, the program has
    missed it and needs to be edited.
  - i'll have to write some print-outs in the code itself to make
    sure that no non-palindromes are incorrectly marked as palindromes.
