Name: Aidan Sawyer [aks5238]

================================================================
Level 0 – Start
Estimated Time	00 10
Plan for this level:
  -run server
  -test general functionality
  -look for typos
  -look for appropriate view/seeds/etc.
  -fix and refresh page

Level 0 – Complete
Actual Time	00 15
Notes : Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

LL:
  -look at the seeds before just editing the database itself (the seed will
   populate the database every time with set objects)

PE:
  -index wasn't too hard to find, but the seed for the db took a bit more time.

================================================================
Level 1 – Start
Estimated Time	00 35
Plan for this level:
  -go through ruby on rails active validations and compare with lvl1 tasks
  -edit thought.rb, using the db schema to find fields.
  -edit thinker.rb, using the db schema to find field names.

Level 1 – Complete
Actual Time	00 45
Notes : Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

LL:
  -validations are not that difficult and easily ensure that the database
   contains correct data from the front end before calling the back end.
   
PE:
  -i have little to no familiarity with regexes. rubular was very helpful.

================================================================
Level 2 – Start
Estimated Time	01 15
Plan for this level:
 1: FIND FILE
  -use grep to find occurrences of 'mine' recursively from front directory
  -search through occurrences to see if any seem to match the description 
   and investigate them.
  -look up where this might be in general.
 2: EDIT FILE
  -existing line of code will likely be a ruby/rails-cloaked database query
   which i should just have to edit with something like a (where thinker=self) 
   kind of tag.
  -look up syntax for that in ruby 
 3: test and debug
 4: refactor

Level 2 – Complete
Actual Time	00 45
Notes : Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

LL:
  -asking for help is helpful
  -'index' is the function that populated all of the different tabs by 
   defining @thoughts.

PE:
  -i knew it had to be a database call and i knew it would be in one of
   the controllers, but i couldn't find where.
