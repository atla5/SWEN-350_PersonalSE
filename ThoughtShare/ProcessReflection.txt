Rails – Thought Share

Name: Aidan Sawyer [aks5238]

================================================================
Level 0 – Start
Estimated Time	00 10
Plan for this level:
  -run server
  -test general functionality
  -look for typos
  -look for appropriate view/seeds/etc.
  -fix and refresh page

Level 0 – Complete
Actual Time	00 15
Notes : Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

TT: 15/10 = 1.5
  -took a bit to think of the 'seed' instead of editing the raw database
   entry.

LL:
  -look at the seeds before just editing the database itself (the seed will
   populate the database every time with set objects)

PE:
  -index wasn't too hard to find, but the seed for the db took a bit more time.

================================================================
Level 1 – Start
Estimated Time	00 35
Plan for this level:
  -go through ruby on rails active validations and compare with lvl1 tasks
  -edit thought.rb, using the db schema to find fields.
  -edit thinker.rb, using the db schema to find field names.

Level 1 – Complete
Actual Time	00 45
Notes : Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

TT: 45/35 = 1.26
  -took a little bit longer than expected with the regexs
  
LL:
  -validations are not that difficult and easily ensure that the database
   contains correct data from the front end before calling the back end.
   
PE:
  -i have little to no familiarity with regexes. rubular was very helpful.

================================================================
Level 2 – Start
Estimated Time	01 15
Plan for this level:
 1: FIND FILE
  -use grep to find occurrences of 'mine' recursively from front directory
  -search through occurrences to see if any seem to match the description 
   and investigate them.
  -look up where this might be in general.
 2: EDIT FILE
  -existing line of code will likely be a ruby/rails-cloaked database query
   which i should just have to edit with something like a (where thinker=self) 
   kind of tag.
  -look up syntax for that in ruby 
 3: test and debug
 4: refactor

Level 2 – Complete
Actual Time	00 45
Notes : Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

TT: 45/75 = 0.6
  -I'm giving myself a lot of buffer time to find the errors. normally when
   you get there the code doesn't take long to figure out.

LL:
  -asking for help is helpful
  -'index' is the function that populated all of the different tabs by 
   defining @thoughts.

PE:
  -i knew it had to be a database call and i knew it would be in one of
   the controllers, but i couldn't find where.

================================================================
Level 3 – Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan for this level:
  *write the thoughts_controller 
  *add thoughts view file. write as per instruction and in the same layout
   as the other view files.
  *fix the routing as per the write-up
  -*use 'rails generate scaffold' and 'rake' to create new field in
   Thought which holds a list of 'thinker_id's
  -edit 'thumbup' to add the active_thinker's id to the list of ids.
  -write 'thumbers' to edit @thinkers to be displayed in the thumbers view.

Level 3 – Complete
Actual Time	02 30
Notes : Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

TT: 150/60 = 2.5
  -i got hardcore stuck on figuring out this integer list thing with the rails
   model. the field i created with the 'rails generate' and 'rake' command 
   did effectively add to the table an integer field (as displayed in
   SQLiteManager), but every time i tried to use it (thought.thumbers) i'd get 
   a "method does not exist" or "no attribute 'thumbers' in nil class" and i 
   couldn't figure out why. 
   
PE:
  -finding the right 10 files to edit if i wanted to make a small change
  -the lack of documentation i could find on how to make lists of things in 
   a rails model

LL:
  -web development is much less straight-forward and more time-consuming 
   than normal application development. it takes practice and a good memory
   for what all you have to change per change.

================================================================
Level 4 - Start
Estimated Time  0 55
Plan for this level:
  -write/run rails command to 'AddEmailToThinker' for the model
  -write validation
  -add email field to 'new thinker' and 'edit thinker' pages
  -show email on the profile page

Level 4 - Complete
Actual Time 00 45
Notes : Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

Time: 45/55 = 0.81
  -took less time than i allotted because i was able to get some help finding
   where '_form' was. other than that i didn't have much trouble finding and
   fixing what i needed

LL:
  -again, help is helpful. helped to break down a wall much faster
  -adding new fields to an existing table is a lot easier than it would seem 
   at first, you just have to know where to go to do things with it afterwards.
