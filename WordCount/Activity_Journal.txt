  -count number of lines by adding incrementor on above for loop.
  -test and compare with first number in wc output
  -add for loop for words in line and an incrementer for numWords
  -test and compare with second number in wc output
  -add for loop for character in word and an incrememnter for numChars

TA:

  -use bash script to call wc and ritwc.py after the other to visually
   compare.
  -use edited bash script to do a 'diff' between the two outputs.
