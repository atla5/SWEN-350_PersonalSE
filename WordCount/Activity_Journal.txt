Start
Estimated Time	00 35
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

OI: 
  -get file input and scrolling through the file to work using 
   'for line in fileName'.
  -count number of lines by adding incrementor on above for loop.
  -test and compare with first number in wc output
  -add for loop for words in line and an incrementer for numWords
  -test and compare with second number in wc output
  -add for loop for character in word and an incrememnter for numChars
  -test and compare with third number in wc output
  -check with shell scripting that i/o works well and overall output fits.

TA:
  -print out the simple text file to check 'for line in fileName' works
  -use bash script to call wc and ritwc.py after the other to visually
   compare.
  -use edited bash script to do a 'diff' between the two outputs.

Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

LL:
  -testing is easy to forget or disregard, but especially in this activity
   it was very easy to write and saved a fair amount of typing.

PE: 
  -had a bit of a difficult time remembering how to get the '<' to work, but 
   once i had that worked out it went pretty smoothly
