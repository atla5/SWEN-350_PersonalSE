Start
Estimated Time	00 35
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI:
  -use fgets to go through the file, incrementing num_lines
  -include string.h to get the length of each line (written to by fgets)
  -use strtok(line," ") to tokenize the line. use for loop to count num_words.

TA:
  -write a bash script to run wc and ./ritwc, write to an output file,
   and then compare the two files

ET:
  -the problem is pretty simple if you use the provided functions.
   i haven't used strtok() much before, so that might take some tweaking

Actual Time	00 45
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

LL:
  -having multiple test scripts, one for specific tests and one for
   comprehensive functionality can be really helpful

PE: 
  -wc has strange formatting. with small files you can just do it by
   spaces, but for larger ones it gets weird. had to look that up.

failed compilations: 5
