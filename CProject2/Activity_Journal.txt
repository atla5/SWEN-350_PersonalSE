C Health Monitoring System Project - Part 2

Name: Aidan Sawyer

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI: 
  -copy over read_line() and some main() functionality from CP1
  -write main() function in health.c using functions from health_util.c
  -start filling out the empty functions in health_util.c in order of
   the prompt (levels)

TA:
  -input file
  -print statements (printAll)

Complete
Actual Time	01 45
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

LL:
  -switch(type) looks really nice. comes with small complications,
   but i like how it turned out.
  -setting it up correctly like this is really nice. shouldn't take
   much each level from here, i think.

PE:
  -cannot declare things inside of a switch statement

TT: 105/90 = 1.1666
  -taking a fair amount of time setting things up well. hopefully
   it's worth it.

===========  Stage 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 25
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI:
  -fill in addHealthType() 
  -fill in printPatient() so that I can see that it worked

TA: 
  -another text file
  -print statements

Complete
Actual Time	00 30
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

LL:
  -i'm getting a lot better with C.

PE:
  -none


===========  Stage 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI: [all functionality completed in Stage2 code]

TA: 
  -same text file
  -printPatient()

Complete
Actual Time	00 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

LL: 
  -planning ahead saves time and effort
  -building up effectively from the beginning saves unnecessary change cost
  -don't write unnecessary code. if you know you're going to have to write
   a formal print funciton and you want to see if your function is working
   by adding a print statement, just write the formal one and save yourself
   some time

===========  Stage 4  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI:
  -initialize reading[] for each new healthType
  -fix the hardcoded 'reading[0]' in addHealthReading()
  -fix the hardcoded 'reading[0]' in printPatient()
  -fix the rewriting old entries

Complete
Actual Time	00 45
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

PE:
  -strcpy is really annoying. i didn't get burned by it or anything,
   i just had to edit things i didn't want to.
  -had some trouble with when the readings are overwritten. had to just
   hardcode back to reading[0]. which is unfortunate. left commented code
   for what i'd wanted

===========  Stage 5  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI: [covered by level 4 submission]

Complete
Actual Time 00 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

PE: again, the overwriting (more than 10 readings) was complicated

===========  Stage 6  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI: [covered by level 5. i think i messed up the order of these a bit
     sorry]

Complete
Actual Time	00 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

PE: these stages are really hard to keep track of

===========  Stage 7  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 25
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI: 
  -edit resetPatient() to 
    -free entire chart
    -create new 

Complete
Actual Time	00 20
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

PE: i can't use valgrind, so i'm not actually sure if there are memory leaks.

===========  PROJECT SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================
(Replace this text with a couple of paragraphs summarizing your
experience with this project. What is too easy or too hard? What
was the most challenging technical problem you faced? How
did your estimated and actual time compare? Did your estimates
improve as you advanced to later stages? Why or why not?)
================================================================

  This project (part 2) was pretty simple. I wish valgrind was installed 
on these and we'd covered more advace forms of free()ing. as is, i'm 
pretty sure that i should be going deeper down, temporarily storing them, 
and freeing those as i go through the list, but this seems to work on top.

  The most challenging technical issue for a while was thinking that i
needed to write all the extra code for abstract linked lists, but when i 
got to actually going through and writing the individual functions, it was
unnecessary. the main was actually really simple to write and i'm pretty 
happy with how simple and nice it worked in the end. 

  my biggest complaint was getting lost in all the stage names. separating
dealing with multiple patients from dealing with individual ones seemed odd
to me, since there's never really a reason to code it so badly as to require
doing them individually, especially given the way that the helper functions
were declared in health.h
