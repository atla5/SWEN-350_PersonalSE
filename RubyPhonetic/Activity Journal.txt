Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
 
LL:
  -don't hesitate to clarify things with the customer
  -testing takes a really long time, but catches some interesting errors
  -don't just do unit tests. you also need to test overall functionality 
   afterwards as well. almost forgot to do file input tests and found an
   error i wouldn't have if i just tested helper functions

PE:
  -wasn't sure how to handle digits. asked and it was fixed
  -spent a really long time with tests.
  -really figured there would be a string.each{ |char| } function. there 
   wasn't. 
  -chomp() is kind of finnicky. you have to be careful with it.
  -'\n' character is important to remember
