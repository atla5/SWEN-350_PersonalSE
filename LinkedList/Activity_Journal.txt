SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
C - LinkedList

Name: Aidan Sawyer

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

OI:
  -create the push, add, and print methods
  -work up from there to the other functions.
  -test, debug, refactor

TA:
  -so far just using the main function and gdb, but that will change 
   as more of the activity is assigned.
  -will expand to run a bash script against known output, most likely.

ET:
  -pretty familiar with both linked lists and C by now and the documentation
   is very decent for each function.

Complete
Actual Time	00 35
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

PE:
  -had a bit of unexpected annoyance with 'struct node' instead of 
   typedef-ing it, so i tried adding that and it didn't like it at
   all (with the struct containing a pointer to a like structure).
   had to change it back, but it worked shortly after.
